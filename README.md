# optimizedMath

This program should be a short piece of code that prints all of the positive integers from 1 to 100 as described more fully
below. The program may contain multiple methods, and if using an OO language, should be contained within a single class
or object. The program should be designed so that it begins execution when invoked through whichever mechanism is most
common for the implementation language.

- Print out all positive integers from 1 to 100, inclusive and in order.
- Print messages to standard output, matching the Sample Output below.
- In the output, state whether the each integer is 'odd' or 'even' in the output.
- If the number is divisible by three, instead of stating that the number is odd or even, state
that the number is 'divisible by three'.
- If the number is divisible by both two and three, instead of saying that the number is odd,
even or divisible by three; state that the number is 'divisible by two and three'.
- Design the logic of the loop to be as efficient as possible, using the minimal number of operations to perform the
required logic.

### Sample Output
```
  The number '1' is odd.
  The number '2' is even.
  The number '3' is divisible by three.
  ...
  The number '6' is divisible by two and three.
  ...
```
